    <h1 class="headings">Son, a woman is like a beer. They smell good, they look good, you'd step over your own mother just to get one! But you can't stop at one. You wanna drink another woman!<h1>

    <p>Look out, Itchy! He's Irish! They only come out in the night. Or in this case, the day. That's why I love elementary school, Edna. The children believe anything you tell them. </p>

    <p>And now, in the spirit of the season: start shopping. And for every dollar of Krusty merchandise you buy, I will be nice to a sick kid. For legal purposes, sick kids may include hookers with a cold. I'm going to the back seat of my car, with the woman I love, and I won't be back for ten minutes!</p>

    <p>Uh, no, they're saying <span>"Boo-urns, Boo-urns."</span> Get ready, skanks! It's time for the truth train! Brace yourselves gentlemen. According to the gas chromatograph, the secret ingredient is… Love!? Who's been screwing with this thing?</p>

    <li>I've done everything the Bible says — even the stuff that contradicts the other stuff!</li>
    <li>Mrs. Krabappel and Principal Skinner were in the closet making babies and I saw one of the babies and then the baby looked at me.</li>
    <li>Kids, we need to talk for a moment about Krusty Brand Chew Goo Gum Like Substance. We all knew it contained spider eggs, but the hantavirus? That came out of left field. So if you're experiencing numbness and/or comas, send five dollars to antidote, PO box…</li>
